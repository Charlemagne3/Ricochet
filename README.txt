Ricochet is a puzzle game in which the goal is to collect "orbs of light" which exist in the game world.  
The is done by propelling a marble-like sphere into the map.  

The game world is a rectangular arena.  The "floor" looks like outer space. 
The exterior have red squishy and spongey material on them.
Inside this arena are mutliple interior walls, which are perfectly flat and yellow.  
The marble starts attached to a side wall, and is blue.  

Each level consists of one of these rectanglular arenas is some configuration.  

The player uses the left mouse button to drag an aimer around the map.  
Right clicking on a sphere will select it.
When the spacebar is pressed, the marble is propelled towards that point.  
The marble has infinite momentum, only stopping when it comes into contact with a side wall, whidh are "sticky".  
The marble will reflect off of and interior walls at the proper angle of reflection.
The marble collects any spheres of light or power ups it comes into contact with.

Power ups will do the following:

Split the marble into multiple parts.
Give the marble decresing momentum.
Change the marble's size.

Whenever the marble is launched, the turn count increases by 1. 
There is also a "par" count, which indicates how many turns the level should be completed in.  
Once all of the spheres of light are collected, the score is recorded and the next level is loaded.

The art assets for the game consist of the following:

Player Sphere: A high resolution shiny blue sphere with radius 1 unit and RGB color (0,0,255).
Orb of Light: A high resolution shiny yellow sphere with radius 0.5 and RGB color (0,255,255).
Power Up: A high resolution shiny green sphere with radius 0.5 and RGB color (0,255,0).
Interior Wall: A rectanglular yellow wall 20 units long, 10 units wide, 1 unit thick, and RGB color (0,255,255).
Exterior Wall: A spongey red material that can be placed on the side wall in a repeatable pattern with approximate dimensions 20 units long, 10 units wide, 1 unit thick, and RGB color (255,0,0).
Background: A high resolution space background, possibly with planet(s) or nebulae.

The difficulty curve of the game increases via using the simple mechanics in interesting ways.  
Lower levels will feature nothing more than a single player sphere and a few walls at simple angles such as 0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 135, 150, 180.
Levels will become more difficult by incrementally introducing further mechanics.
Power ups, walls at strange angles, and multiple player spheres can be added.
